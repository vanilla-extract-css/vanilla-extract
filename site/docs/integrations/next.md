# Next.js

A plugin for integrating vanilla-extract with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Installation

```bash
npm install @vanilla-extract/next-plugin
```

## Setup

If you don't have a `next.config.js` file in the root of your project, create one. Add the plugin to your `next.config.js` file.

```js
const {
  createVanillaExtractPlugin
} = require('@vanilla-extract/next-plugin');
const withVanillaExtract = createVanillaExtractPlugin();

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {};

module.exports = withVanillaExtract(nextConfig);
```

If required, this plugin can be composed with other plugins.

```js
const {
  createVanillaExtractPlugin
} = require('@vanilla-extract/next-plugin');
const withVanillaExtract = createVanillaExtractPlugin();

const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')({
  extension: /\.mdx$/
});

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {};

module.exports = withVanillaExtract(withMDX(nextConfig));
```

## Debug Identifiers

If you want to automatically generate debug IDs during development, you can add the [Babel](https://babeljs.io) plugin.

```bash
npm install @vanilla-extract/babel-plugin
```

Note that this step will cause Next.js to switch from [SWC](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) to Babel, increasing build times. This may or may not be an issue depending on the size of your project.

> Note: While optional for Next.js, the Babel plugin is still required when trying to run `.css.ts` files in Node for unit testing since the files are no longer being processed by a bundler.

If you don't have a `.babelrc` file in the root of your project, create one. Add the Babel plugin to your `.babelrc` file, ensuring that you're also including `"next/babel"` in your `presets` array.

```json
{
  "presets": ["next/babel"],
  "plugins": ["@vanilla-extract/babel-plugin"]
}
```

## Configuration

The plugin accepts the following as optional configuration:

### identifiers

Different formatting of identifiers (e.g. class names, keyframes, CSS Vars, etc) can be configured by selecting from the following options:

- `short` identifiers are a 7+ character hash. e.g. `hnw5tz3`
- `debug` identifiers contain human readable prefixes representing the owning filename and a potential rule level debug name. e.g. `myfile_mystyle_hnw5tz3`

Each integration will set a default value based on the configuration options passed to the bundler.
