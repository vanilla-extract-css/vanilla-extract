# 🍬 treat migration guide

🎉 First of all, thanks for using treat, and thanks for your interest in vanilla-extract!

When we first started work on vanilla-extract, it actually began life as `treat-next` — an experiment with replacing our custom webpack-based theming system with CSS Variables. However, we quickly realised that the theming system was too different to carry the same name. That said, they're similar enough that migrating shouldn't be too hard (relative to migrating to another library).

We've made sure that both treat and vanilla-extract can run simultaneously in the same project, so if you have a lot of treat files, don't feel like you have to migrate everything at once!

## New file extension

The file extension has changed from `*.treat.ts` to `*.css.ts`.

## `.css.ts` files can import other `.css.ts` files

This wasn't possible in treat with `*.treat.ts` files. If you've had to work around this limitation in the past, you don't need to worry anymore!

## Your webpack config must handle CSS files

In treat, we automatically handled all generated CSS files for you. With vanilla-extract we've taken a more lightweight approach. Instead, we generate regular global CSS files and assume you've configured webpack to handle this. This makes things a lot simpler, but also a lot more configurable.

For more detail, check out the [webpack setup guide.](https://github.com/vanilla-extract-css/vanilla-extract#webpack)

## Autoprefixer is no longer included

If you want Autoprefixer, you'll need to [manually add it to your webpack config.](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader#autoprefixer)

Note that this also means you have a lot more control over the handling of generated CSS. For example, you might want to use [postcss-preset-env](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader#postcss-preset-env) instead.

## URL handling should be disabled for `*.vanilla.css` files

In treat, we set css-loader's [`url` option](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/#url) to `false`. This was to ensure that JavaScript import statements were always used for assets (e.g. `import logoUrl from './logo.png'`) rather than allowing the CSS to create implicit imports (e.g. `background: "url('./logo.png')"`).

If you want to reinstate treat's approach to asset imports without affecting other CSS files, you can configure css-loader separately for `*.vanilla.css` files. For example:

```ts
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        oneOf: [
          {
            test: /\.vanilla\.css$/i,
            use: [
              MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
              {
                loader: 'css-loader',
                options: { url: false }
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            use: [MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader, 'css-loader']
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    new VanillaExtractPlugin(),
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin()
  ]
};
```

## `createTheme`

If you only have a single theme, you can keep things simple by using `createGlobalTheme` and targeting `:root`. If you do this, your variables will just work without having to wire anything up to the document.

```ts
// vars.css.ts

import { createGlobalTheme } from '@vanilla-extract/css';

export const vars = createGlobalTheme(':root', {
  ...tokens
});
```

If you have multiple themes, or if you want to avoid the global scope, use the [`createTheme`](https://github.com/vanilla-extract-css/vanilla-extract#createtheme) function instead.

```ts
// vars.css.ts

import { createTheme } from '@vanilla-extract/css';

export const [themeA, vars] = createTheme({
  ...tokens
});

export const themeB = createTheme(vars, {
  ...tokens
});
```

If you're bundle-splitting your themes, you'll probably want the [`createThemeContract`](https://github.com/vanilla-extract-css/vanilla-extract#createthemecontract) function.

## `TreatProvider`

> 💡 This isn't required if you only have a single global theme set up via `createGlobalTheme`.

You no longer need React bindings to switch themes at runtime since we're just using standard CSS Variables. Instead of using something like `TreatProvider` at the root of your app, you need to attach your theme class to an element instead.

```tsx
// App.ts

import { themeClass } from './vars.css';

export const App = () => (
  <div className={themeClass}>...</div>
);
```

## Theme tokens must be strings

To avoid errors when migrating unitless numbers to CSS Variables, numbers are no longer accepted as theme token values. This forces you to be explicit about `px` units, or lack thereof, since we can't know ahead of time where the variable will be used. Think of it as writing a CSS string rather than a JavaScript value since this goes directly into the generated CSS Variable definition.

```diff
const themeClass = createGlobalTheme(':root', {
-  grid: 4,
+  grid: '4px',
});
```

If you need a unitless number, just convert it to a string as-is.

```diff
const themeClass = createGlobalTheme(':root', {
-  headingWeight: 600,
+  headingWeight: '600',
});
```

## Theme classes must be forwarded through React portals

> 💡 This isn't required if you only have a single global theme set up via `createGlobalTheme`.

CSS Variables don't follow the rules of React context, which means that theming won't automatically work when [rendering to a portal.](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) To handle this, you'll need to ensure your theme class is available on context so you can access it when needed.

As a basic example, let's set up a `VanillaThemeContext`.

```tsx
// VanillaThemeContext.tsx

import { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

const VanillaThemeContext = createContext<string | null>(
  null
);

export const VanillaThemeProvider =
  VanillaThemeContext.Provider;

export const useVanillaTheme = () => {
  const themeClass = useContext(VanillaThemeContext);

  if (themeClass === null) {
    throw new Error('Must be inside VanillaThemeProvider');
  }

  return themeClass;
};
```

We can then use this `VanillaThemeProvider` at the root of our app.

```tsx
// App.tsx

import { createContext, useContext } from 'react';
import { themeClass } from './vars.css';
import { VanillaThemeProvider } from './VanillaThemeContext';

export const App = () => (
  <VanillaThemeProvider value={themeClass}>
    <div className={themeClass}>...</div>
  </VanillaThemeProvider>
);
```

We can now access the theme via our custom `useVanillaTheme` Hook and apply it to the root element of our portal.

```tsx
// MyPortalComponent.tsx

import { createPortal } from 'react-dom';
import { useVanillaTheme } from './VanillaThemeContext';

export const MyPortalComponent = () => {
  const themeClass = useVanillaTheme();

  return createPortal(
    <div className={themeClass}>...</div>,
    document.body
  );
};
```

## `useStyles` / `resolveStyles`

The whole concept of `styleRefs` and `useStyles`/`resolveStyles` goes away. No more plumbing required, just access the CSS exports directly.

```diff
-import { useStyles } from 'react-treat';
-import * as styleRefs from './styles.treat';
+import * as styles from './styles.css';

export const Foo = () => {
-  const styles = useStyles(styleRefs);

  return (
    <div className={styles.root}>
      ...
    </div>
  );
}
```

## `style`

Since theme variables are now managed by the browser, the `style` function no longer accepts a theme callback.

To get access to variables, we now import theme variables from the `.css.ts` file that defines them.

```diff
-import { style } from 'treat';
-
-const className = style(theme => ({
-  paddingTop: theme.space.small
-}))

+import { style } from '@vanilla-extract/css';
+import { vars } from '../vars.css';
+
+export const className = style({
+  paddingTop: vars.space.small
+});
```

Note that this means the theme is no longer global! You don't need to worry about setting up [global theme types,](https://seek-oss.github.io/treat/data-types#theme) and you can run multiple sets of theme variables in parallel.

## Style calculations

> **⚠️ When it comes to inline style calculations, CSS Variables are inherently more limited than treat's theming system. This is because you can only use standard CSS functions rather than being able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.**
>
> If your app only has a single theme and you think this change is too limiting, you might want to consider avoiding CSS Variables entirely and using a shared object of constants and calculating all theme-based styles at build time instead.

Theme variables are now opaque CSS Variables (i.e. `"var(--g7vce91)"`) rather than actual token values that differ per theme, which means you can't perform JavaScript calculations on them.

Simple calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are covered by CSS's `calc` function. To make this a bit easier in TypeScript, we provide a [`calc`](https://github.com/vanilla-extract-css/vanilla-extract#calc) function in the `@vanilla-extract/css-utils` package.

```diff
-import { style } from 'treat';
-
-const className = style(theme => ({
-  marginTop: theme.space.small * -1
-}))

+import { style } from '@vanilla-extract/css';
+import { calc } from '@vanilla-extract/css-utils';
+import { vars } from '../vars.css';
+
+const className = style({
+  marginTop: calc.negate(vars.space.small)
+});
```

If you're doing anything more advanced with theme variables that the browser doesn't natively support (e.g. rounding numbers, modifying colours), you'll need to hoist this logic into your theme as CSS Variables.

For example, let's assume you've calculated a lighter colour variant inline using [Polished.](https://polished.js.org/)

```ts
import { style } from 'treat';
import { lighten } from 'polished';

export const className = style((theme) => ({
  background: lighten(0.2, theme.color.brand)
}));
```

Since this calculation is not yet supported natively in CSS, this lighter background would need to become part of your theme definition. In this case, we'll introduce a new `color` variable called `brandLight`. Notice that in this context we're able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

```ts
// vars.css.ts

import { createGlobalTheme } from '@vanilla-extract/css';
import { lighten } from 'polished';

const brandColor = 'blue';

export const vars = createGlobalTheme(':root', {
  color: {
    brand: brandColor,
    brandLight: lighten(0.2, brandColor)
  }
});
```

You would then update your styles to use this new CSS Variable instead.

```diff
-import { style } from 'treat';
-import { lighten } from 'polished';
+import { style } from '@vanilla-extract/css';
+import { vars } from '../vars.css';

-export const className = style(theme => ({
-  background: lighten(0.2, theme.color.brand)
-}));
+export const className = style({
+  background: vars.color.brandLight
+});
```

## `styleMap`

You can use [`styleVariants`](https://github.com/vanilla-extract-css/vanilla-extract#stylevariants) as a drop-in replacement. Note that it now accepts a map function as the second argument, so there may be some opportunities to simplify your code if you were mapping over objects before passing them to `styleMap`.

## `styleTree`

Since you now have direct access to theme objects outside of a style block, this function is no longer necessary.

## `@keyframes`

The `@keyframes` property is no longer supported on style objects. Instead, you should create keyframes separately with the `keyframes` function.

```diff
-import { style } from 'treat';
-
-const className = style({
-  '@keyframes': { ... },
-  animationName: '@keyframes'
-});

+import { keyframes, style } from '@vanilla-extract/css';
+const myAnimationName = keyframes({ ... });
+
+const className = style({
+  animationName: myAnimationName
+});
```
