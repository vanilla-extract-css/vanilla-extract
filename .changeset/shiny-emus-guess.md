Add new `inlineCssInDev` option to `unstable_mode` configuration property

Setting `unstableMode: 'inlineCssInDev'` will result in all CSS generated by Vanilla Extract being inlined into a `style` element at the top of the document `head`. This feature is useful for preventing [FOUC] (Flash of Unstyled Content) when server-rendering your initial HTML. Without this, calling `ssrLoadModule` on your server entrypoint will not include the CSS in the HTML, leading to a FOUC when the client-side JavaScript takes over.

Note that CSS will only be inlined in development mode. Production builds are unaffected by this setting.

**EXAMPLE USAGE**:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { vanillaExtractPlugin } from '@vanilla-extract/vite-plugin';

export default {
  plugins: [
    vanillaExtractPlugin({
      unstable_mode: 'inlineCssInDev',
    }),
  ],
}
```
